Unlearning the breakthrough ai, was modelled by celiobjr, a 3rd UG student. A 2k follower account’s tweet sparked massive interest in the tech circuits and clocked 3.5mn impressions before the account & GIT got taken down by bigger players, who possibly felt intimidated with the breakthrough. 

This model decentralises singularity and currently - a small team of 3, with AI background from FANG are hard at work, enabling this to life.

A Solona project is affiliated with the coin & was endorsed by the dev, highlighting it in good faith and to prevent any further abuse.
